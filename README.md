# AeroSpec-Project
The project aims to find the impact of wildfire to the air quality of our daily lives. My codes provide various time-series data analyses and visualizations to allow audience clearly see the effects of wildfire on PM2.5 concentrations.
Analysis folder include raw codes that help preprocess PM2.5 concentration data collected by our sensors. It also includes calibration code that helps calibrate our sensors' data to match Puget Sound Air's sensor data.
Figures folder include plots created by Python.
Reports include a PDF file that details the regresssion calibration.
